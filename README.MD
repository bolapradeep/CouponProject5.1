# Analysis of Coupons

Goal of this project is visualization and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those did not.

Used [coupons.csv](data\coupons.csv) dataset for analysing the data. This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. 

Analysed data located in [prompt.ipynb](prompt.ipynb) file, which conatins various analysis done. 

I looked at coupons offered for bars and coffee houses

Following are my observations:
1. Overall Proportion of coupons accepted are 56%
1. Proportion of bar coupon accepted 41%
1. Proportion of Coffee House coupons accepted: 50%
